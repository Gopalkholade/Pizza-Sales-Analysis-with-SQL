# SQL Analytics Project: Pizza Sales Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. We'll explore various aspects of the dataset, including order quantities, revenue, pizza types, and more. The goal is to gain insights that can inform business decisions related to pizza sales.

## Dataset

Before diving into the specific questions, let's briefly describe the dataset:

- **Tables**: We'll work with several tables, including an `Orders` table, a `Pizzas` table, and potentially other related tables.
- **Columns**: Key columns include `order_id`, `pizza_id`, `quantity`, `price`, `size`, and `order_date`.

## Basic Questions

1. **Retrieve the total number of orders placed**

2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales**

3. **Identify the highest-priced pizza**

4. **Identify the most common pizza size ordered**

5. **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities**

## Intermediate Questions

1. **Total quantity of each pizza category ordered**

2. **Distribution of orders by hour of the day**

3. **Category-wise distribution of pizzas**

4. **Average number of pizzas ordered per day**

5. **Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue**

## Advanced Questions

1. **Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue**

2. **Cumulative revenue generated over time**

3. **Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category**

## Conclusion
